# python-lessons

## Description

This repo holds all the introductory lessons of Python covered in Week 2. We learned about lists, tuples, dictionaries, classes, namedtuples, entry points, and functions. We practiced with coding challenges and demonstrated our knowledge with the command line story project. Also, during Week 3, we covered how to read and write csv's using os and pandas.

It also contains an introduction to Flask from Week 3, where I learned how to setup the necessary folders, files, and routes, then created a basic business page.

### Story Project

My command line story project takes the user on a journey across the Moon in order to rescue the dying Opportunity Mars, where you first must select the necessary materials for navigating the dangerous trek and then make various decisions based on the prompts displayed.

The gif provided shows the quickest route, however, depending on what/how much you select there are different outcomes that will most likely require the user to start over. Some examples include: not selecting oxygen first, not selecting enough oxygen (thus running out of time), going over the weight limit, choosing the wrong direction, etc.

### Basic Business Page

This is a basic outline for a business page that is mobile-responsive and includes some JavaScript for a side navigation bar.
